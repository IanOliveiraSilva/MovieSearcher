# Movie Search

The project is a movie search site where you can search for movie titles and see a list of results. Clicking on a movie from the list displays a details page with information such as title, release year, synopsis, and poster image. The site uses the IMDb API to fetch movie information.

The objective of the project is to create a simple and intuitive interface for searching for movies, allowing the user to quickly find information about the movies of interest.
